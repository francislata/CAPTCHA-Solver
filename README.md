# CAPTCHA Solver

## Introduction
This project creates a convolutional neural network based architecture to determine the three characters present given a CAPTCHA image. Note that a blog post about this project has been written [here](http://francislata.blot.im/epoch-1-captcha-cnn-classifier).

## How to run
`CAPTCHA Solver - End-to-end CNN Approach.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that can be run which contains more technical detail and implementation of this model.

## Results:
**Training dataset accuracy:** 98.95%
**Validation dataset accuracy:** 99.74%

## Credits
Thank you to Geetika Garg's for the model architecture used in this project. In addition, thank you to [fateleak](https://github.com/fateleak) for providing a decent size CAPTCHA image dataset that can be found [here](https://github.com/fateleak/captcha-dataset).
